IPv4, IPv6, and ICMP downloaded image

TTL values can show what OS a packet was generated from 64 being Linux, 128 being windows, and 255 being cisco routers

Fragmentation (IPv4) splits large amounts of data into multiple packets in order to send it all, turning on the fragmentation offset and and more fragments bit until the last packet which just has an offset

ZERO CONFIGURATION (what happens to something that isnt configured)
IPv4 Auto Configuration
* APIPA
* RFC 3927

IPv6 auto configuration
* SLAAC (StateLess Address Auto-configuration)
* RFC 4862

TRANSPORT LAYER
OSI LAYER 4

TCP and UDP header downloaded
(for tcp flags read like trying to read binary from left to right)

TCP uses 3-way handshake to establish connection sending a SYN receiving a SYN/ACK then responding with an ACK then tears down with two sets sent by both machines of FIN/ACK followed by ACK

BERKELEY PACKET FILTERS (BPF)
Requests a SOCK_RAW socket and setsockopt calls SO_ATTACH_FILTER
sock = socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL))
...
setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, ...)

BERKELEY PACKET FILTERS
Using BPFs with operators, bitmasking, and TCPDump creates a powerful tool for traffic filtering and parsing.

tcpdump {A} [B:C] {D} {E} {F} {G}

A = Protocol (ether | arp | ip | ip6 | icmp | tcp | udp)
B = Header Byte offset
C = optional: Byte Length. Can be 1, 2 or 4 (default 1)
D = optional: Bitwise mask (&)
E = Operator (= | == | > | < | <= | >= | != | () | << | >>)
F = Result of Expresion
G = optional: Logical Operator (&& ||) to bridge expressions
w = write to a given fileExample:
tcpdump 'ether[12:2] = 0x0800 && (tcp[2:2] != 22 && tcp[2:2] != 23)'

BITWISE MASKING
To filter down to the bit(s) and not just the byte.
ip[0] & 0x0F > 0x05

FILTER LOGIC - MOST EXCLUSIVE
All designated bit values must be set; no others can be set
tcp[13] = 0x11
--or--
tcp[13] & 0xFF = 0x11

FILTER LOGIC - LESS EXCLUSIVE
All designated bits must be set; all others may be see
tcp[13] & 0x11 = 0x11

FILTER LOGIC - LEAST EXCLUSIVE
At least one of the designated bits must be set to not equal 0; all others may be set
tcp[13] & 0x11 !=0

================================= PROGRAMMING =======================================

PACKET CREATION AND SOCKET PROGRAMMING

SOCKET TYPES
Stream Sockets - Connection oriented and sequenced; methods for connection establishment and tear-down. Used with TCP, SCTP, and Bluetooth.
Datagram Sockets - Connectionless; designed for quickly sending and receiving data. Used with UDP.
Raw Sockets - Direct sending and receiving of IP packets without automatic protocol-specific formatting.

USER SPACE VS. KERNEL SPACE SOCKETS
User Space Sockets
Stream Sockets
Datagram Sockets
Kernel Space Sockets
Raw Sockets

SOCKET CREATION AND PRIVILEGE LEVEL
User Space Sockets - The most common sockets that do not require elevated privileges to perform actions on behalf of user applications.
Kernel Space Sockets - Attempts to access hardware directly on behalf of a user application to either prevent encapsulation/decapsulation or to create packets from scratch, which requires elevated privileges.

USER SPACE APPLICATIONS/SOCKETS
Using tcpdump or wireshark to read a file
Using nmap with no switches
Using netcat to connect to a listener
Using netcat to create a listener above the well known port range(1024+)
Using /dev/tcp or /dev/udp to transmit data

KERNEL SPACE APPLICATIONS/SOCKETS
Using tcpdump or wireshark to capture packets on the wire
Using nmap for OS identification or to set specific flags when scanning
Using netcat to create a listener in the well known port range (0 - 1023)
Using Scapy to craft or modify a packet for transmission

Types

NETWORK PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON3
Network sockets primarily use the Python3 Socket library and socket.socket function.
import socket
  s = socket.socket(socket.FAMILY, socket.TYPE, socket.PROTOCOL)

THE SOCKET.SOCKET FUNCTION
Inside the socket.socket. function, you have these arguments, in order:
socket.socket([*family*[,*type*[*proto*]]])
family constants should be: AF_INET (default), AF_INET6, AF_UNIX
type constants should be: SOCK_STREAM (default), SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW
proto constants should be: 0 (default), IPPROTO_RAW

RAW IPV4 SOCKETS
Raw Socket scripts must include the IP header and the next headers.
Requires guidance from the "Request for Comments" (RFC)to follow header structure properly.
RFCs contain technical and organizational documents about the Internet, including specifications and policy documents.
See RFC 791, Section 3 - Specification for details on how to construct an IPv4 header.

RAW SOCKET USE CASE
Testing specific defense mechanisms - such as triggering and IDS for an effect, or filtering
Avoiding defense mechanisms
Obfuscating data during transfer
Manually crafting a packet with the chosen data in header fields

ENCODING AND DECODING
Encoding
The process of taking bits and converting them using a specified cipher.

Decoding
Reverse of the conversion process used by the specified cipher for encoding.
Common encoding schemes
UTF-8, Base64, Hex
