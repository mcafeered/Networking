Encapsulation and Decapsulation

Layer 4 - TCP Segment
Layer 3 - IP Packet
Layer 2 - Ethernet Frame
Layer 1 - Bits

PHYSICAL LAYER
OSI LAYER 1

RESPONSIBILITIES

Hardware Specifications
Encoding and Signaling
Data Transmission and Reception
Physical Network Design


DATA LINK LAYER
OSI LAYER 2

DATA LINK SUB-LAYERS

MAC (Media Access Control)
LLC (Logical Link Control)

ETHERNET HEADER
Dest. Mac = 6 bytes |
Src. Mac  = 6 bytes | - Mac Header/Trailer
Ethertype = 2 bytes |

Payload/Data/SDU = 46-1500 Bytes

CRC/FCS = 4 Bytes

802.1Q HEADER - adds a VLAN TAG between the Src. Mac and the Ethertype that is 4 bytes

ARP HEADER - downloaded image

Ethertypes
0x0800  IPv4
0x0806  ARP
0x86DD  IPv6
0x8100  VLAN TAG


NETWORK LAYER
OSI LAYER 3

IPv4, IPv6, and ICMP downloaded image

TTL values can show what OS a packet was generated from 64 being Linux, 128 being windows, and 255 being cisco routers

Fragmentation (IPv4) splits large amounts of data into multiple packets in order to send it all, turning on the fragmentation offset and and more fragments bit until the last packet which just has an offset

ZERO CONFIGURATION (what happens to something that isnt configured)
IPv4 Auto Configuration
* APIPA
* RFC 3927

IPv6 auto configuration
* SLAAC (StateLess Address Auto-configuration)
* RFC 4862

TRANSPORT LAYER
OSI LAYER 4

TCP and UDP header downloaded
(for tcp flags read like trying to read binary from left to right)

TCP uses 3-way handshake to establish connection sending a SYN receiving a SYN/ACK then responding with an ACK then tears down with two sets sent by both machines of FIN/ACK followed by ACK

SESSION LAYER
OSI LAYER 5
